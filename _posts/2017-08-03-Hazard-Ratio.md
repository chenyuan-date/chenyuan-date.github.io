### Definition of Hazard Ratio

**Hazard ratio** (HR) is a measure of **an effect **of **an intervention **on **an outcome** of interest over time. Hazard ratio is reported most commonly in time-to-event analysis or survival analysis (i.e. when we are interested in knowing how long it takes for a particular event/outcome to occur). The outcome could be an negative outcome (e.g. time from treatment/surgery until death/relapse) or a positive outcome (e.g. time to cure/discharge/conceive/heal or disease-free survival).

Hazard Ratio (i.e. the ratio of hazards) = Hazard in the intervention group / Hazard in the control group

Hazard represents the instantaneous event rate, which means the probability that an individual would experience an event (e.g. death/relapse) at a particular given point in time after the intervention, assuming that this individual has survived to that particular point of time without experiencing any event.

**Confidence Interval (CI):** is the range of values that is likely to include the true population value and is used to measure the precision of the study’s estimate (in this case, the precision of the Hazard Ratio). The narrower the confidence interval, the more precise the estimate. (Precision will be affected by the study’s sample size). If the confidence interval includes 1, then the hazard ratio is not significant.

### Interpretation of Hazard Ratio

Because Hazard Ratio is a ratio, then when:

**HR = 0.5: **at any particular time, **half** as many patients in the treatment group are experiencing an event compared to the control group.
**HR = 1: **at any particular time, event rates are the **same** in both groups,
**HR = 2: **at any particular time, **twice** as many patients in the treatment group are experiencing an event compared to the control group.
