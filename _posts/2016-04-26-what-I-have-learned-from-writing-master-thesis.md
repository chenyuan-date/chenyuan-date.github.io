It's said that "Good memory than rotten written". To have a good memory and to learn from the past, I would like to write down notices in the process of writing my master thesis in 2016.    

Theis have several parts, I will write from the following aspects:  
     
# Writing skills in chinese     

```
1. 形容词（代词）+的+名词
   副词+地+动词
   动词+得+副词
2. there is a space between english and chinese words ("作者 JIM 和"，其中 JIM 前后各有一个空格)
```

# Writing skills in english      

```
1. there is a space between number and unit (10 M)
2. 
```

# Notices in generating figures     

```
1. if the legend is not clear, just regenerate them via AI
2. word font and size of the figures should be the same through the whole thesis
3. figure and legend should be in the same page
```

# References

```
1. follow the citation format the thesis request.
2.
