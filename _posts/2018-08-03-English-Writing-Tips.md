#### Abstract 

Several tenses can be used. The tense you would use largely depends on the subject of your sentence. As a general rule:

- Any statements of **general fact** should be written using the **present tense**.
- Any discussion about **prior research** should be explained using the **past tense**.
- If the **subject of your sentence is your study or the article** **you are writing** (e.g. “Our study demonstrates…,” or “Here, we show…”), then you should use the **present tense**.
- If you are stating a **conclusion or** an **interpretation**, use the **present tense**.
- If the subject of your sentence is an **actual result or observation** (e.g. “Mice in Group B developed…”), you would use the **past tense**.

## Tips for choosing words

#### Be precise 

Avoid lazy phrase:"gives important insight into"                  

> The signal of gene A and gene B was near => The `signals` of gene A and gene B `were close  `                  

#### Be specific 

mouse not animal   

increased not changed 

> Gene A is required for normal development

> Gene A is required for plant normal development

> Gene A is required for the normal development of rice

#### Be simple 

`used`  not `utilized`

`before use` not `prior to use`

`begin` not `commence` or `initiate`

#### Be necessary 

 `we found gene A varied` not `gene A was examined and found to vary`  

`Phylogenetic analysis showed that` not `Based on phylogenetic analysis, we showed that`    

#### Use active verbs 

`the mouse consumed oxygen at a higher rate ...` 

rather than `oxygen was consumed by the mouse at a higher rate ...`

####  Do not use contractions      

Use `it is, cannot, does not` rather than `it's, can't, doesn't`            

#### Put important words first                  

*A significant reduction of gene A expression was detected by RT-PCR analysis.*                        

rather than        

`By RT-PCR analysis, we found a significant reduction of gene A exoression.`      



## Better expression 

- one remaining question => `one outstanding issue` (悬而未决的问题)
- interestingly => `unexpectedly ` (avoid emotional words)                              
- not found => `undetected`
- the decreased expression => `the expression reduction`
- A similar trend was observed => `We observed a similar trend` (尽量用主动而非被动)    
- Reduced expression than => `Reduced expression as compared to`     



## Other notes

- Some verbs require that the following verb is in `-ing` form      

  {enjoy, avoid, succeed in, finish, keep, mind, practice, risk} + *verb-ing*          

- Useful verbs:

  represent, analyze, compare, demonstrate, illustrate, summarize, conclude, list, define, report, model, implement, design, consider, involve, simplify, generalize, perform, be based on sg., take into account sg, increase, decrease, evaluate, predict, assign, require, satisfy, ...
