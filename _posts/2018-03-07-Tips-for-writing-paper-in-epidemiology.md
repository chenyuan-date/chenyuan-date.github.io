这学期参加了一个journal club “tell me something I don't know about cancer”，获益匪浅。特别是通过交流学习，是我这种小白对epidemiology和cancer有了更深的认识。           

通过对每次journal club上文章的critisize, 不仅培养了批判性思维，还同时对该领域的文章结构有了很清晰的认识。很好的东西，必须记下来，好记性不如烂笔头嘛。写文章的时候对照这些问题，就会删了很多bug呢。

同时，主持journal club的Ofure还给我们推荐了` a Series on Evaluation of Scientific Publications` ，该书的第一章[`Critical Appraisal of Scientific Articles `](https://www.aerzteblatt.de/pdf.asp?id=63438) 就是告诉我们如何严谨的写作科研文章。经常读读是大有裨益的，该书共21章，每章针对不同的方面都会有专题，特别专业。



以下是在写流行病学方面文章需要的注意事项，从三个方面来总结：

## Introduction 

Title, Introduction and Purpose               

- Does the title adequately reflect the work content? Is it unbiased?             
- Does it attract the appropriate readership?             
- Is there evidence of a literature review? If so, is it recent (in last five years)?         
- Is the problem statement/introduction clearly described?            
- Is it relevant to the topic selected and does it show the objectives or aims of the research article?                     
- Is the research question or hypothesis clear?                      
- Is it informative, research-based and does it support the purpose/problem?               



## Methods and Results 

Materials, Methods and Results                       

- What information is there on the sample size and characteristics-selection bias?                    

- What sampling technique was used to collect the data?                

- How were ethical considerations handled/IRBE approval obtained?                  

- Do the methods match the purpose?                         

- What statistical methods were utilized - were they appropriate?                    

- Are the results clearly presented - are they significant?                 

- Does the data presentation match the described methods?       

  ​

## Conclusions

Discussion and conclusion                     

- What conclusions are drawn by the author?                       
- Are the statements well supported by the literature?                       
- Are they consistent with the study objectives and limited to the data in the study?                  
- How does the study contribute to the body of knowledge?                    
- Is there any implication for clinical practice?                           


- Can the conclusions be generalized to various settings or populations of people?                        


- What additional question does this study raise?                 


- What are the flaws or limitations of the study?                  


- Is there a need to contact the author?
