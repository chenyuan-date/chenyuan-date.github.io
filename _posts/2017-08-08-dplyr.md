# install and load packages

```r
#install.packages("dplyr")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr))

dim(ChickWeight) #Use the default ChickWeight dataset as example
```

```
## [1] 578   4
```

```r
head(ChickWeight)
```

```
##   weight Time Chick Diet
## 1     42    0     1    1
## 2     51    2     1    1
## 3     59    4     1    1
## 4     64    6     1    1
## 5     76    8     1    1
## 6     93   10     1    1
```

```r
?ChickWeight  #disply the explanation of ChickWeight dataset
```

# count(): tally observations based on a group    
It is slightly similar to the table function in the base package.            

```r
count(ChickWeight, Diet)
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##     Diet     n
##   <fctr> <int>
## 1      1   220
## 2      2   120
## 3      3   120
## 4      4   118
```

# summarise(): summarise values
create summary statistics for a given column or multiple columns in the data frame. Like basic function `aggregate()`
It is very powerful when used in conjunction with the other functions in the dplyr package.   

There are many summary statistics you could consider such as `mean`, `sd()`, `min()`, `max()`, `median()`, `sum()`, `n()` (returns the length of vector), `first()` (returns first value in vector), `last()` (returns last value in vector) and `n_distinct()` (number of distinct values in vector).  

```r
summarise(ChickWeight, mean(weight, na.rm = T)) #conbine with na.rm = TRUE, remove all NA values while calculating
```

```
##   mean(weight, na.rm = T)
## 1                121.8183
```

```r
#Calculate multiple statistics
summarise(ChickWeight, mean(Time, na.rm = T), min(weight))
```

```
##   mean(Time, na.rm = T) min(weight)
## 1              10.71799          35
```

# group_by(): group data by one or more variables
`group_by` is related to concept of "split-apply-combine". We literally want to split the data frame by some variable (e.g. taxonomic order), apply a function to the individual data frames and then combine the output. Usually used with `summarise()` function     

```r
G1 <- group_by(ChickWeight, Diet) #group by Diet
head(G1)
```

```
## # A tibble: 6 x 4
## # Groups:   Diet [1]
##   weight  Time Chick   Diet
##    <dbl> <dbl> <ord> <fctr>
## 1     42     0     1      1
## 2     51     2     1      1
## 3     59     4     1      1
## 4     64     6     1      1
## 5     76     8     1      1
## 6     93    10     1      1
```

```r
summarise(group_by(ChickWeight, Diet), mean(Time, na.rm = T), mean(weight), sum(weight), total=n())
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 5
##     Diet `mean(Time, na.rm = T)` `mean(weight)` `sum(weight)` total
##   <fctr>                   <dbl>          <dbl>         <dbl> <int>
## 1      1                10.48182       102.6455         22582   220
## 2      2                10.91667       122.6167         14714   120
## 3      3                10.91667       142.9500         17154   120
## 4      4                10.75424       135.2627         15961   118
```

# sample(): select random rows           

```r
sample_n(ChickWeight, size = 6) #randomly selects n rows from the dataset
```

```
##     weight Time Chick Diet
## 439     61    4    39    3
## 374    146   18    33    3
## 371    137   12    33    3
## 234     55    2    22    2

## 368     77    6    33    3
```

```r
sample_frac(ChickWeight, size = 0.01) #randomly selects 1% of the rows from the dataset.
```

# arrange(): re-order or arrange rows by variables
To arrange (or re-order) rows by a particular column such as the taxonomic order. Similar to the basic `order()` function.

```r
A1 <- arrange(ChickWeight, weight, Diet)
A2 <- arrange(ChickWeight, desc(weight), Diet) #show decreasing order with desc() function
```

# filter(): select rows
The `filter()` function will return all the rows that satisfy given conditions. Like basic function `subset()`   
Boolean operators:
==, >, >=, <, <=, !=, %in%                        
&, |, !, xor()                      
is.na()                  
between(), near()                     

```r
#For numeric conditions
F1 <- filter(ChickWeight, weight > 50, Time < 3)
F1 <- filter(ChickWeight, weight > 50&Time < 3) #The conditions can be seperated by "&" or ","

#For factor or character conditions
F2 <- filter(ChickWeight, Chick == "1") #For factor or characters, "==" should be used
F3 <- filter(ChickWeight, Chick %in% c("1", "3")) #To filter with multiple variables, use "c()" with "%in%"
F4 <- filter(ChickWeight, Chick == "2", Diet == "1")

# Combine numeric, factor and character conditions
F5 <- filter(ChickWeight, weight > 50, Chick %in% c("1", "3"))
```

# select(): select columns 
Select and exclude columns based on specific criteria:   
`starts_with()` = Select columns that start with a character string       
`ends_with()` = Select columns that end with a character string         
`contains()` = Select columns that contain a character string          
`matches()` = Select columns that match a regular expression                                   
`one_of()` = Select columns names that are from a group of names      
`everything()` = select all columns

```r
S1 <- select(ChickWeight, Time, Diet) #select the second and fourth columns by names
S2 <- select(ChickWeight, -Time, -Diet) #exclude columns by using "-" (subtraction/negative indexing) operator
S3 <- select(ChickWeight, weight:Diet) #select a range of columns by name, use the ":" (colon) operator
S4 <- select(ChickWeight, starts_with("Ch")) #select all columns that start with the character string "Ch", use the function starts_with()
S5 <- select(ChickWeight, ends_with("t")) # #select all columns that end with the character string "t", use the function ends_with()
S6 <- select(ChickWeight, contains("ic")) # #select all columns that contain the character string "ic", use the function contains()
S7 <- select(ChickWeight, matches(".e.")) # #select all columns that match with the character string ".e.", use the function matches()
var <- c("Diet", "Time")
S8 <- select(ChickWeight, one_of(var)) # #select all columns that match with the character vector, use the function one_of()
S9 <- select(ChickWeight, everything()) # #select all columns, use the function everything()
```

# mutate(): create new columns
The `mutate()` function will add new columns to the data frame (separated by commas). Like basic function `transform()`

```r
M1 <- mutate(ChickWeight, Diff = weight - mean(weight), Ratio = weight/mean(weight))
```

# join(): join two datasets together 
```
inner_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, suffix = c(".x", ".y"), ...)   
left_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, suffix = c(".x", ".y"), ...)     
right_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, suffix = c(".x", ".y"), ...)   
full_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, suffix = c(".x", ".y"), ...)     
semi_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...)       
anti_join(x, y, by = NULL, copy = FALSE, ...)   

by: a character vector of variables to join by. Natural join using all variables with common names across the two tables by default.  
	To join by different variables on x and y use a named vector. For example, by = c("a" = "b") will match x.a to y.b.
```

```r
x <- data.frame(CustomerId = c(1:6), Product = c(rep("Toaster", 3), rep("Radio", 3)))
y <- data.frame(CustomerId = c(2, 4, 6), State = c(rep("Alabama", 2), rep("Ohio", 1)))
x; y
```

```
##   CustomerId Product
## 1          1 Toaster
## 2          2 Toaster
## 3          3 Toaster
## 4          4   Radio
## 5          5   Radio
## 6          6   Radio
```

```
##   CustomerId   State
## 1          2 Alabama
## 2          4 Alabama
## 3          6    Ohio
```

## `inner_join()`: Include only rows in both x and y that have a matching value

```r
inner_join(x, y)
```

```
##   CustomerId Product   State
## 1          2 Toaster Alabama
## 2          4   Radio Alabama
## 3          6   Radio    Ohio
```

## `left_join()`: Include all of x, and matching rows of y

```r
left_join(x, y) #the same as right_join(y, x), except column position
```

```
##   CustomerId Product   State
## 1          1 Toaster    <NA>
## 2          2 Toaster Alabama
## 3          3 Toaster    <NA>
## 4          4   Radio Alabama
## 5          5   Radio    <NA>
## 6          6   Radio    Ohio
```

## `right_join()`: Include all of y, and matching rows of x

```r
right_join(x, y) #the same as left_join(y, x), except column position
```

```
##   CustomerId Product   State
## 1          2 Toaster Alabama
## 2          4   Radio Alabama
## 3          6   Radio    Ohio
```

## `semi_join()`: Include rows of x that match y but only keep the columns from x  
## `anti_join()`: Include rows of x that not match y. Opposite of semi_join

```r
semi_join(x, y)
```

```
##   CustomerId Product
## 1          2 Toaster
## 2          4   Radio
## 3          6   Radio
```

```r
anti_join(x, y)
```

```
##   CustomerId Product
## 1          1 Toaster
## 2          3 Toaster
## 3          5   Radio
```

## `full_join()`: return all rows and all columns from both x and y. NA was used for not matching value.   

```r
full_join(x, y)
```

```
##   CustomerId Product   State
## 1          1 Toaster    <NA>
## 2          2 Toaster Alabama
## 3          3 Toaster    <NA>
## 4          4   Radio Alabama
## 5          5   Radio    <NA>
## 6          6   Radio    Ohio
```

# pipe operator(%>%): chain code together
This operator allows you to pipe the output from one function to the input of another function. Instead of nesting functions (reading from the inside to the outside), the idea of of piping is to read the functions from left to right.     

```r
P1 <- ChickWeight %>%
  filter(Chick != c(15, 18, 20, 27)) %>%
  group_by(Diet) %>%
  summarise(mean(Time, na.rm = T))
```

```r
P2 <- ChickWeight %>%
  filter(weight >= 50, Diet != 1) %>%
  mutate(DiffTime = Time - mean(Time, na.rm =T)) %>%
  select(Diet:DiffTime) %>%
  head
```
