## Must have a bottom line          

-  bottom line is the important information you want to convey in your paper: 

  - What was the question that you wanted to answer?     

  - What is the significance of the conclusion?      

  - What is the new advance of your discovery?      

-  **Repeat the bottom line over and over again**:     
   -  at the end of abstract         
   -  in the introduction     
   -  in the results      
   -  in the discussion      
   -  总之，一定要让文章的概括句重复多次出现在不同部分，让读者知道你在干嘛                 



## Title 

- The title should `reflect the factual content` of the paper.               

- A good title is straightforward and uses `keywords` that researchers in a particular field will recognize.     

- Make the title as strong as the data can withstand. (标题要高度凝练的概括出你的发现)           

- Specificity is very important! (体现出该研究的不同之处，也就体现出了价值)       

- Make title concise by omitting unnecessary words.        

  `study of`, `nature of` (unnecessary words)      

  `non-pulmonary tissues` instead of `liver, brain, and stomach, but not lung`                        

- If possible, put the most important word first.

  **LAZY1** controls rice shoot gravitropism (this word is specific) through regulating polar auxin transport.     

  **Increased expression of MAPKK7** causes deficiency in polar auxin transport and leads to plant architectural abnormality in Arabidopsis.      


## Running title 

- A running title is a short phrase that appear at the top or bottom of every page of a journal article.      

- Should be recognizable as a short version of the title.      

  *Title*: Transcriptomic footprints disclose specificity of reactive oxygen species signaling in Arabidopsis.            

   *Running title*: ROS-induced gene expression     

  *Title*: Activation of the imprinted *Dlk1-Dio3* region correlates with pluripotency levels of mouse stem cells.        

  *Running title*: *Dlk1-Dio3* region regulates cell pluripotency         



## Abstract 

An abstract should contain:     

- background 
- a question    
- what was done    
- what was found     
- the conclusion / answer    
- implications (optional)        



What first got you excited about this research? 

-- make sure you convey the reason and that excitement.          



## Introduction      

- Three basic elements of introduction:            

  - The big picture of significance of the field/topic.        
  - Summary of previous discoveries.               
  - How your work adds to or contradicts to the existing picture.                

- Only present relative information. Introduction is not a review of literatures!!!      

- logic follow:        

  `Known` --> `unknown` --> `your specific question`        

- Briefly summarize what the reader is going to learn and why it is important at the end of introduction.       



## Results 

- Arrange paragraphs either chronologically or put the most important results first.     

- It often works well to let the story unfold in the way it actually happened.      

- Data are facts, results are statements that interpret those data.      

- Explain your data to help readers to understand.      

  the expression *was higher in mutant*                    

  the enzyme activity *increased*       

- In each paragraph, put the most important result (e.g. central finding) first and less important results (e.g. control) later.       

- When citing the work of others, try to state their findings ("Sec9 is up-regulated in rho-cells") rather than or in addition to their conclusion ("secretion is controlled by mitochondria").              

- Summarize the trend and conclusion of your figures, but do not repeat data from figures.       



## Figures and Tables

- Each figure should have a clear point/purpose.         
- Avoid complicated figures if you can.           
- Figure legends are important.         
- If possible, use simple labels so that people can get a quick idea of the figure's logic without reading the legend.     
- Decide what you are trying to compare, and make it easy for the readers.       



## Materials and Methods  

- List what methods were used to generate the results, then write down what you did to carry out the experiments.     
- Order your materials and methods part logically as the flow of your experiments.      
- Keep the section brief by describing your unique techniques and condensing those that are common practice.        
- Define or expand all non-standard abbreviations.            



## Discussion 

- Discussion is the place where you can put your findings in perspective, propose a model, outline a direction of investigation, and make the readers think.      

- But, **do not stretch too much**.      

- Clearly distinguish what you have shown and what you imagine.                

- Provide extra evidence to support your findings and the bottom line of your paper.         

- Start by a quick run-through of the main results.     

  - state the answer to your main question               
  - briefly summarize the supporting evidence        

- Organize subsequent topics from most to least important.        

- End by restarting the answer and/or discussing implications and future directions.       

#### What to discuss          

- How your results affect the field, not the details of your results.       

- To what extent your findings are new vs. confirmatory.        

- Reveal any shortcomings. conflicts, or limitations of your data.               

- Outline explanations for unexpected data.         

- State advantages or shortcomings of your methods, if there is any.              

- Reveal any large areas that remain as a complete mystery.             

- Include some speculations, if possible.       

- Include different levels at which your results are significant .              


#### Commonly used expressions        

- `Several lines of evidence` have shown ...       
- Our results `suggested` ...                 
- The findings reported here `indicated` ...           
-  Results reported here will `shed light on` ...      
- We speculate ... 
- Be cautious when using `important`, `significant`, `great`, `excited` ...




## Revising

- Do not rush in sending out your manuscript!
- *Rewrite the title and abstract* after completing the draft.
- Put the finished manuscript aside for a few days, then read it again. 
- Pay specific attention to logic flow.
- Read *at least 5 times* before submission!
- Double check references.
- Ask someone else to read your manuscript.



## Write cover letter

- Be short (usually no longer than one page)
- Emphasize on what is known and why your finding is important 
- Follow the journal's requirement
- Address to the right journal  



## Write response letter

- Be polite 

  >```
  >We agree with the referee that…,but
  >The referee is right to point out…,yet
  >In accordance with the referees' wishes,we have now changed this sentence to…
  >Whilst we agree with the referee that…
  >It is true that…,but
  >We acknowledge that our paper might have been…., but
  >We too were disappointed by the low response rate…
  >We agree that this is an important area that requires furthr research…
  >We support the referee's assertion that…,although
  >With all due respect to the reviewer,we felt that this point is  not correct…
  >```

- Answer the reviewer's questions point-by-point

- Be political ???啥意思？？？
