### Definition
Youden's J statistic (also called Youden's index) is a single statistic that captures the performance of a dichotomous diagnostic test. Informedness is its generalization to the multiclass case and estimates the probability of an informed decision.

```
J = sensitivity + specificity âˆ’ 1
```
[Formula of youden index](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/db350d81cb3c935786da783e16bf66a0b287d8a2)     

The index value ranges from -1 to 1:        
J = 0: a diagnostic test gives the same proportion of positive results for groups with and without the disease, i.e the test is useless.          
J = 1: there are no false positives or false negatives, i.e. the test is perfect.                  



### Find cut-offs with `OptimalCutpoints`   

```r
library(pROC)
library(OptimalCutpoints)
data(aSAH)
head(aSAH)
```

```

## 29    5    Good Female  42    1  0.13  3.01
## 30    5    Good Female  37    1  0.14  8.54

```r
# plot roc curve with pROC package
rocobj <- plot.roc(aSAH$outcome, aSAH$s100b, percent = TRUE, main="ROC", col="#1c61b6", add=FALSE)

This method can find cut-off for one variable each time, but not for multiple variables    



### Find cut-off with `Epi`    

The Epi package did was to fit a logistic regression        

```r
library(pROC)
library(Epi)

ROC(form=outcome~s100b, data=aSAH, plot = "ROC", MX = T)
```

![](/images/Youden-index-unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)

```r
ROC(form=outcome~ndka, data=aSAH, plot = "ROC", MX = T)
```

![](/images/Youden-index-unnamed-chunk-3-2.png)

```r
ROC(form=outcome~ndka+s100b, data=aSAH, plot = "ROC", MX = T)
```

### Find cut-off with `pROC`

```r
library(pROC)
data(aSAH)

plot.roc(aSAH$outcome, aSAH$s100b,main="Confidence interval of a threshold",
         percent=TRUE, ci=TRUE, of="thresholds", # compute AUC (of threshold)
         thresholds="best", # select the (best) threshold
         print.thres="best") # also highlight this threshold on the plot
```
