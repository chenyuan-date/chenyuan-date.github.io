# R introduction

## Rstudio
https://www.rstudio.com/
RStudio is a free and open-source integrated development environment (IDE) for R, a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. RStudio was founded by JJ Allaire,[5] creator of the programming language ColdFusion. Hadley Wickham is the Chief Scientist at RStudio.

## ggplot2    
ggplot2 is a data visualization package for the statistical programming language R. Created by Hadley Wickham in 2005. It's a function to build plots piece by piece. The concept behind ggplot2 divides plot into three different fundamental parts: Plot = data + Aesthetics + Geometry.

The principal components of every plot can be defined as follow:  
```
- data is a data frame                          
- Aesthetics is used to indicate x and y variables. It can also be used to control the color, the size or the shape of points, the height of bars, etc.
- Geometry defines the type of graphics (histogram, box plot, line plot, density plot, dot plot, ..)
```

There are two major functions in ggplot2 package: 
```
- qplot() stands for quick plot, which can be used to produce easily simple plots.
- ggplot() function is more flexible and robust than qplot for building a plot piece by piece.
```

Install and load ggplot2 package:
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

## plot type selection
### One variable: Continuous
```
geom_area(): Create an area plot
geom_density(): Create a smooth density estimate
geom_dotplot(): Dot plot
geom_freqpoly(): Frequency polygon
geom_histogram(): Histogram
stat_ecdf(): Empirical Cumulative Density Function
stat_qq(): quantile - quantile plot
```
### One variable: Discrete
### Two variables: Continuous X, Continuous Y
```
geom_point(): Scatter plot
geom_smooth(): Add regression line or smoothed conditional mean
geom_quantile(): Add quantile lines from a quantile regression
geom_rug(): Add marginal rug to scatter plots
geom_jitter(): Jitter points to reduce overplotting
geom_text(): Textual annotations
```
### Two variables: Continuous bivariate distribution
```
geom_bin2d(): Add heatmap of 2d bin counts
geom_hex(): Add hexagon bining
geom_density_2d(): Add contours from a 2d density estimate
```
### Two variables: Continuous function
### Two variables: Discrete X, Continuous Y
```
geom_boxplot(): Box and whiskers plot
geom_violin(): Violin plot
geom_dotplot(): Dot plot
geom_jitter(): Strip charts
geom_line(): Line plot
geom_bar(): Bar plot
```
### Two variables: Discrete X, Discrete Y
### Two variables: Visualizing error
```
geom_crossbar(): Hollow bar with middle indicated by horizontal line
geom_errorbar(): Error bars
geom_errorbarh(): Horizontal error bars
geom_linerange() and geom_pointrange(): An interval represented by a vertical line
Combine geom_dotplot and error bars
```
### Two variables: Maps
### Three variables

## Interesting R
```{r}
n=50000;
r=0.7;r_e=(1-r*r)^.5;
X=rnorm(n);
Y=X*r+r_e*rnorm(n);
Y=ifelse(X>0,Y,-Y);
plot(X,Y,col="red", main = "Pure Love")
```

I love you more than I can say
```{r}
n=50000;
r=0.7;r_e=(1-r*r)^.5;
X=rnorm(n);
Y=X*r+r_e*rnorm(n);
Y=ifelse(X>0,Y,-Y);
a<-sample(c(2,6,7,8),50000,T)
b<-sample(c(76,79,86,69),50000,T)
plot(X,Y,col=0, main = "Love is colorful")
text(X,Y,"lOVE",col=a)
```

Embarrassing
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
f <- function(x) 1/(x^2-1)
x <- seq(-3,3, by=0.001)
y <- f(x)
d <- data.frame(x=x,y=y)

p <- ggplot()
p <- p+geom_rect(fill = "white",color="black",size=3,
                 aes(xmin=-3, xmax=3, ymin=-3,ymax=3, alpha=0.1))

p <- p + geom_line(data=d, aes(x,y), size=3)+ylim(-3,3)
p <- p + theme_bw() +
    theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
          axis.text.y=element_blank(),
          legend.position="none",
          panel.grid.minor=element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major=element_blank(),
          panel.background=element_blank(),
          axis.ticks=element_blank(),
          panel.border=element_blank())

p <- p+xlab("")+ylab("")
print(p)
```
So, R is quite interesting and attracting, why not learn it. Let's go~
