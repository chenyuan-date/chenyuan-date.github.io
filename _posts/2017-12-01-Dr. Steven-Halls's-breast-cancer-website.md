一个加拿大的放射科学家，[Dr. Steven Halls，所建设的一个网站](http://breast-cancer.ca/)。网站以漫画的风格对乳腺癌基础知识进行科普，风趣幽默，值得一看。

This website with information on breast cancer, **mixes** the **medical** information and the **average person’s point-of-view**, plus Dr. Halls sense of humor and the Moose to be super serious.

This site describes the many common and less common types of breast cancer and other benign and malignant breast diseases. It covers breast cancer screening, staging, and tumor grading. The focus is **mostly** on **diagnosis** and **laboratory** results, but there is also some **treatment** information and **prognosis** information, although for the absolutely best, latest, state-of-the-art information on treatment options, it’s always best to directly talk to an **oncologist** specializing in breast cancer.
